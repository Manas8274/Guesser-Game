# Guesser-Game
This is a Java-based Number Guessing Game where a Guesser guesses a number, and Players try to guess the same number. The Umpire determines the winners.

## How to Play

1. The Guesser chooses a random number from a range that is given.
2. The Players are asked if they would want a tip on the Guesser's possible guesses.
3. Players place their wagers between the Guesser's number and a 10-unit range above and below.
4. If a Player requests a hint, it is given.
5. Based on matching predictions, the umpire declares the winners.
6. The Guesser's number is made public if no one wins.
